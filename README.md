# A Collection of Clustering / Subspace Clustering Algorithms

## 1. Clustering Algorithms
- **K-means**
- **K-means++ <sup>[1]</sup>**
- **ISODATA (Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis)**
    - To be brief, ISODATA includes two additional operations: Splitting and Merging;
    - When the number of observations within one class is less than one pre-defined threshold, ISODATA merges two classes with minimum between-class distance; 
    - When the within-class variance of one class exceeds one threshold, ISODATA splits this class into two different sub-classes.

## 2. Subspace Clustering Algorithms
- **Subspace K-means**
- **Entropy-Weighting Subspace K-means <sup>[2]</sup>**
